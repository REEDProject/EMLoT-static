<h2>
    Navigating the Database
</h2>
<p>
    The EMLoT database comprises a number of interlinked records of different
    types: Transcription Records, Primary &amp; Secondary Sources, Events,
    People,  Troupes and Venues. Because of the way in which EMLoT's data is
    structured and  interlinked, navigating through the database can be an
    open-ended  multi-directional journey if you click on a new link in every
    record you view.  However, in almost all situations you will be starting by
    carrying out a search that will produce a results list. Whether you see a
    list of matching records generated by a search, or a list of associated
    records linked to a particular record, you can then select any of the
    individual records comprising that list.  Note that in many situations, you
    will be able to backtrack by clicking on your browser’s Back button.  In
    other situations, however, material will be opened in a new tab in your
    browser, and you can backtrack simply by closing this tab.
</p>
<h2>
    How to Search
</h2>
<p>
    There are two ways to search the EMLoT database: by Keyword(s) or by using
    the faceted Browser. The search pages are accessible by selecting 'Search
    the Database' and then, in the submenu, selecting either 'Keyword Search'
    or 'Browse Search'.
</p><br/>
<p>
    <strong>Keyword Search</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To search by keyword(s), enter one or more words into the search box in the
    left column. Below the search box, you can select whether you want to search
    for your keywords in the data EMLoT holds about Primary Sources, Secondary
    Sources, People, Events, Troupes or Venues (Events are selected by default).
    The meaning of most of these types of data in EMLoT are self explanatory,
    but definitions of some of these types of data are available on the Key
    Terms page (see submenu above).
</p><br/>
<p>
    To execute a Keyword search, after typing in the word or words you wish to use select the 'Go' button to the right of the
    search box. The matching items will display in the Matching Records Display
    on the right. The number in parentheses in the 'Matching Records' headings
    is the total number of items returned by the search. To view a particular
    item, click on the portion that is highlighted (in blue). This will take
    you to the page of the selected item. The selected item will be displayed
    in a new tab by your browser.  Thus, you can return to the search/matching
    items page by simply closing this new tab.  In some types of lists (events,
    for example), some columns contain linked text as well. For instance, the
    column containing people associated with an event will have links to the
    displays EMLoT can produce about those people. Here too, if you click on a
    person’s name, the display of information will open in a new tab in your
    browser.  Close the tab to return to the list.
</p><br/>
<p>
    EMLoT uses the “fuse” text search engine, so the parsing of multiword text
    searching follows
    <a href="https://www.fusejs.io/examples.html#extended-search">its rules</a>.
    For the record type you have selected, the keyword search will search for
    each word you have entered, and only items containing <em>all</em> the words
    in the list will be selected. For example, if you entered
    <em>Christopher  Beeston</em>
    and selected 'People,' the Keyword Search will search for and return all
    people records where 'Christopher' AND 'Beeston' appears as a Forename OR
    Surname.  Double quotes around multiple words will cause the fuse engine to
    look for the words as a  phrase.
	<p><br/>
	<p>Remember that the fuse engine implements
    what is called a <em>fuzzy search</em>, so what is selected may include words that
    are not an exact match for what you have specified. Furthermore, the keyword seach
	mechanism draws on data <em>associated with</em> its entities, not just the entity itself.  
	Thus for example, choosing to search on Persons, and entering the name "Edward" will not only
	get people named Edward, but also those with assocations with people named Edwards.  John More
	appears in an "Edward" search, for example, because he is associated with an issue
	about ground rent that involved Edward Alleyn.
</p><br/>
<p>
    To search using the same keyword(s) in another type of data, select the
    desired data type from the submenu of types in the “Search for” area and
    enter the keyword(s) again.
</p><br/>
<p>
    <strong>Browse Search</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Explanation</em>
</p>
<p>
    The faceted browser, which is the primary navigation mechanism in EMLoT, can
    be opened by choosing “Search the database” from the top menu, and then
    choosing “Browse”. The Browse display starts by showing you all the items of
    the chosen type in the right area.  Browse starts by focusing on Events,
    but you can make the browser work on other data types by choosing one of
    the types under the “Search for” heading.
</p><br/>
<p>
    Having chosen the kind of data you want to explore, you then can narrow your
    search through filtering caused by selecting in the left hand area various
    facets and elements within those facets. The facets are grouped according to
    the following categories: Document: Description, Citation, Event &amp;
    Person, Troupe &amp; Venue, and Dates. Selecting these categories opens up
    submenus that contain the facets, which, when selected, open up further
    menus of the elements of these facets. The number in parentheses following
    each element represents the number of items in which that element appears.
    The facets and their elements constitute authority lists, created by
    EMLoT's editor, that have enabled the standardization, classification and
    sophisticated searchability of EMLoT's content.
</p><br/>
<p>
    <em>How to Use the Browse Search</em>
</p>
<p>
    When you select an element, the items matching your selection will appear in
    the Selected Elements Display above the Matching Records Display. When an
    element is selected, the number of occurrences of the other elements in the
    facet choosing area decrease or elements disappear to reflect the matching
    records that are associated with the selected element. Selected facet
    elements can be removed one by one by clicking on the X button next to the
    last element in the Selected Facets Display.  You can also start over by
    choosing “Reset Search” which is displayed near the top of the facetted
    selection area.
</p><br/>
<p>
    To use the faceted browser effectively, you should have a clear sense of
    your search goals, or at least a clear sense of the next step in your
    search.  For example, if you wanted to search for primary sources relating
    to the Phoenix/Cockpit Theatre first you need to choose “Primary Sources”
    in the gray box – this will cause the search to focus on primary sources.
    Having done this, you would select the Troupe &amp; Venue category, then
    the Venue Name facet, then the Phoenix/Cockpit element. This element would
    then appear in the Selected Elements Display as Troupe &amp; Venue | Venue
    Name | Phoenix/Cockpit, and the matching primary sources displayed in the
    list to the right.
</p><br/>
<p>
    In this Matching Items list area, you will find a list of every primary
    source in the EMLoT database that has been related to the Phoenix/Cockpit
    theatre. For each of these items the "Title" column has highlighted
    entries.  Click on one of these to see the particular material EMLoT has
    for that primary source. Alternatively, one could look up information about
    one of the authors associated with a primary source by clicking on his/her
    name in the first column of results.
</p><br/>
<p>
    Having selected primary records associated with the Phoenix/Cockpit, you can
    filter further focusing only on those particular records.  For example, by
    opening Citation | Author Name one can select an author who wrote a primary
    source that refers to the Phoenix/Cockpit. You will see that there are five
    sources written by Massinger that fit this criteria.  Choosing him will
    change the list of sources on the right to be those specific five.  If you
    wish, you could repeat the process again to add further filters.  Overall,
    then, the experience of using the facetted browser is one of a step-by-step
    process, adding multiple filters one after the other to focus on items that
    might interest you.  If you wish to start again from the beginning, you can
    “reset search” by clicking on that text near the top of the lefthand facet
    selection area.
</p><br/>
<p>
    <em>What do the facets mean?</em>
</p>
<p>
    The facets and their elements constitute authority lists, created by EMLoT's
    editor, that have enabled the standardization, classification and
    sophisticated searchability of EMLoT's content.
</p><br/>
<p>
    When you start a browsing sequence, you can choose what kind of items to
    browse: Events, Venues, Troupes, People, Transcription Records, or Primary
    or  Secondary Sources.  Perhaps surprisingly, for all these kinds of
    browsing items you will find the kinds of facets available to you stays the
    same.  What does any of these facets mean for the different kinds of target
    items?
</p><br/>
<p>
    If you are focusing on Events, say, it is probably immediately clear what it
    means to filter on one of the facets: Event Type.  Even the meaning of
    choosing something like “Person Surname” in the light of events is
    straightforward enough: “find me all events that involve person(s) with the
    selected surname."  However, if instead of Events, you choose Primary
    Sources as your target, and you then choose “Event Type” as your facet –
    what is meant by that?  Most of the time, the selection passes through
    “events”.  In this case, then, you are asking for Primary Sources that
    contain one or more events of the selected type.  Similarly, focusing on
    Primary Sources, but choosing to filter on Troupe Type will choose primary
    sources that describe one or more events that involve the selected type of
    Troupe.
</p><br/>
<p>
    A final example: if you were focusing on persons, and chose a particular
    Troupe as a filter, it might be natural to assume that you would get the
    list of persons who were part of that Troupe.  However, if one remembers
    that facet selection passes through “events” it becomes clear that all
    persons associated with events that were connected to the selected troupe
    would be included, and some of these people would not necessarily be actual
    troupe members.
