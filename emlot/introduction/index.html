    How EMLoT helps
</h2>
<p>
    <br/>
    <strong>By identifying Sources</strong> <br/>
    The core function of the <em>Early Modern London Theatres</em> (EMLoT)
    database is to show how information produced at the time of the early London
    theatres was transmitted in later years.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Consequently, the database only includes information from Primary Sources,
    that is documents written before 1642, which were subsequently seen and
    transcribed (copied) by writers in Secondary Sources, that is documents
    written  after 1642. In this way, the database both provides information
    which was  contemporary with the early theatres and also identifies the
    means by which  that information came to be known more widely in the
    centuries afterwards.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    One Primary Source might have its information transcribed in more than one
    Secondary Source, and the same Secondary Source could transcribe more than
    one  Primary Source. The database manages and reveals both situations.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The database describes where in the Primary or Secondary sources you will
    find the relevant information about the early London theatres, and it
    describes  each source, whether Primary or Secondary, exactly, so that you
    can cite all  its publication details. This includes its original title and
    how it is now  known; its short and full title; its author(s); where it can
    be consulted in  full, including its presence in any digitised collection;
    whether it is now  lost or can be considered a forgery. All the
    bibliographical facts necessary  for you to identify, describe, access and
    record a source of information,  whether created before or after 1642, are
    included in the database.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The database also provides a summary and an Abstract of that information in
    the Primary Source which was subsequently transcribed in the Secondary
    source.  It tells you how the Primary Source was treated by the later
    transcriber, for  example, whether it was copied in full or excerpted, or
    had its spelling and  punctuation updated. By recording transcriptions of
    every kind, faithful,  excerpted, emended or otherwise adulterated, the
    database enables you to  consider not only the frequency with which a
    primary source was published, but  also its various treatments over time,
    and at the hands of different editors:  which documents tend to be preserved
    whole, and which heavily excerpted; which  preserved in facsimile, and which
    modernized.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <strong>By categorising Sources</strong> <br/>
    The database categorises both the Primary and Secondary Sources in
    considerable  detail, so that you know exactly what kind of documents you
    are dealing with.  For example, letters, accounts, and jest books appear
    among the many categories  of Primary Sources; anthologies, diaries, and
    monographs appear among the  rather fewer categories of Secondary Sources.
    It also tells you whether the  Source was produced under the auspices of any
    institution, listing, for  example, the Primary Sources generated by the
    Court of Chancery or the many  Secondary Sources which are the products of
    single authors with no significant  institutional links.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    It also tags each source in a more thematic way using a number of helpful
    descriptors to enable you to refine your searches: for example, it might
    identify a source as ‘anti-theatrical’ or ‘topographical’ or ‘parliamentary’
    in  character.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <strong>By categorising the information in Sources</strong> <br/>
    The database also categorises the contents of all its sources into the
    people,  the places, the acting troupes, and the events about which they
    include  information. From this you can learn both about the pre-1642
    theatres  themselves, by accessing the contents of those Primary Sources
    which were later  transcribed, and also about the filtration process through
    which that original  information has come down to us in Secondary Sources:
    who was involved in  passing on that information, what they selected, and
    when and where they passed  it on.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The database also sub-categorises its people, places, troupes and events in
    a more descriptive way so that, for example, you can look for all events of
    a  particular kind, public disturbances, for instance; or for the different
    social  and situational roles which the same person might have performed in
    an event,  such as a widow who also appeared as plaintiff in a court case;
    or for the  countries of origin of playing troupes, or for all the
    theatrical information  related to a particular London locale, such as St
    Martin in the Fields. The  original historical occurrences about which the
    Primary Sources recorded  information are themselves dated since there could
    be a considerable delay  before they were referred to in the Primary Source
    document.
</p>
<p>
    <br/>
    <strong>By interlinking all information</strong> <br/>
    This database is not only a finding tool, like an Index, or an alphabetical
    bibliography. It can be used like that: you can conduct a simple Keyword
    Search  for a specific item which you already know you want to study. But by
    linking up  all the categories and sub-categories of its sources, and of the
    information  they contain, the database has enabled you to explore, starting
    anywhere in the  records and discovering how pieces of information are
    related. This is called a  Browse Search. With it you can search and sort
    any combination of terms while  preserving the discrete identity of the
    Primary Sources in which the  information originated and the Secondary
    Sources through which it passed.
</p>

<h2>
    What EMLoT does not include
</h2>
<p>
    EMLoT aspires to be a major encyclopedic resource on the early London stage,
    as well as a comprehensive historiographical survey of the field. However,
    it  does not include every subsequent quotation of a particular Primary
    Source.  Even if such completeness were possible, it would obscure the route
    by which  Primary Sources become known to a wider audience. So the database
    cites only  those Secondary Sources where the database compilers are
    reasonably confident  that the Primary Source was actually seen (in reality
    or photographic  facsimile) before being transcribed — allusions and
    paraphrases are generally  not enough to earn a place in EMLoT!
</p>
<br>
<p>
    This database does not include play texts, but, for example, it will reveal
    which play texts became more widely available through eighteenth-century
    collections and thus it charts the formation of the canon of early modern
    English drama. Play texts can be accessed electronically through other sites
    such as
    <acronym title="Early English Books Online">EEBO</acronym> and <acronym title="Eighteenth Century Collections Online">ECCO</acronym>.
